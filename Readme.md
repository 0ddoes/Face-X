Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made solution to implement. So In this project all kind of algorithms are implemented and even with various operations that can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only high-resolution static shots and performed insufficiently.

### Demonstration of different algorithms and operations on faces 

#### [Recognition-Algorithms](https://github.com/akshitagupta15june/Face-X/tree/master/Recognition-Algorithms)
 

Despite the availability of a variety of open source face recognition algorithms, there are no ready-made solutions which can be implemented directly. This project demonstrates all kinds of algorithms and various operations that can be implemented on a frontal face. The available algorithms process only high-resolution static shots and perform sufficiently well.

There are several approaches for an algorithm to recognize a face. An algorithm can make use of statistics, try to find a pattern which represents a specific person or use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
