# About:

Backgroud blurring is most often seen as a feature of portrait mode in phone cameras. Another example is of zoom and other online platforms that blur the background and not the face. So, here we provide you a small code to test this effect out.

# Dependencies:

- OpenCV
- Python

# How to run:

- Downlod the directory.
- Open PyCharm or Jupyter notebook.
- Run `main.py`.

### Note:
 This code might show error in VScode. PyCharm and jupyter notebook works fine.

# Output:
