# FACE-X
Recognition of faces by model training using OPENCV

We will first train the model by our faces and then use recognition system.

I have recorded 300 faces of mine in part 1 and trained the model using part 2 then final recognition is done in part 3.

I have added a LBPHFaceRecognizer for recognizing faces.

This can be used for automatic face detection attendance system in recent technology.

Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made solution to implement. The available algorithms processed only high-resolution static shots and performed insufficiently.
