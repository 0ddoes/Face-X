
# Face Detection Using Caffe:

## About:

To perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It has a huge applications 

## Files included:

- The `source code`
- The `Caffe prototxt` files for deep learning face detection (defines model architecture)
- The `Caffe weight` files used for deep learning face detection (contains the weights of actual layers)
- The `example images` 

## Output:

In this given image face is detected with 74% confidence using OpenCV deep learning face detection. 

### Example 1:

### Example 2:

In this another example the OpenCV DNN Face detector finds all three images without any trouble.
