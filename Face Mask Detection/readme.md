- Here, we use training, testing and validation datasets. All, these folders contain images of persons from real life.
- Load the datasets
- We visualize the datas, then build a model for our desired purpose
- Train our model
- Check the loss and accuracy of our model
- Then, check how many are wearing/not wearing mask through a confusion matrix
