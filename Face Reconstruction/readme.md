## AbstractüìÉ:
- Face as a biometric identification in computer vision is an important medium, in areas such as 
  - video surveillance
  - animation games
  - security 
  - anti-terrorist 
has a very wide range of applications, creating vivid, strong visibility of 3d face model, now has become a challenging in the field of computer vision is one of the important topics.

- Using camera calibration, three-dimensional data of facial images were extracted using the functions of OpenCV computer vision library, and then 3d face model were reconstructed.

## Introductionüìù:

- As a branch of stereo vision, 3D facial reconstruction is getting more and more importance in the field of animation, medical cosmetology and privacy protection.
- Traditional 3D facial reconstruction approach is mainly based on prior information and model, in which 3D facial information is collected by modifying the standard model according to individual difference. 
- Such approach suffers from huge complexity and unobvious detailed information. The introduction of theory of computer vision further pushed forward the development of 3D reconstruction, in that 3D information could be retrieved by multiple 2D images through simulated bionics computation. 
- 3D facial reconstruction has been an important and popular topic in the cross section of computer vision and graphics. 
- As a traditional mark for identification, human face could be used for identity recognition, security monitoring, and video games. 
- The requirement and expectation for 3D facial reconstruction are expanding, along with the wider application of 3D facial model



## What is facial reconstruction‚ùì‚ùì

- Facial reconstruction means to develop a three dimensional structure of face using a two dimensional input and different restructuring techniques.

- Face reconstruction creates a 3D face model from a set of input such as image(s), video, or depth data.

## Applications‚ú®:
These technologies are higly used in:

- Forensic science 
- anthropology

To recreate the appearance that best resembles the original face of the deceased, in an effort to stimulate public recognition that will eventually contribute to personal identification

## Why computerized facial reconstruction is better than manual facial reconstruction?üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

- The computer-based reconstructions were found to be more rapid and objective in nature. 
- Unlike the manual techniques, when the same input was given, it would always result in producing the same output.
- Furthermore, it was possible to generate many faces with little variations from the same skull. 
- An advantage of this system, thus, was that the reconstruction work could be carried out on the image of the actual skull, rather than a replica as in manual reconstructions 

## How does 3D data extraction work?!:

- OpenCV, short for Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open source library containing C functions and C++ classes which are developed by R&D lab of Intel in Russia. Through OpenCV, common image processing and computer vision algorithms could be implemented, such as feature detection and tracking, motion analysis, object segmentation and recognition, and 3D reconstruction, etc.

- Due to the efficient and elegant source code in
OpenCV, in which most functions have been optimized
for excellent performance based on the design architecture
of Intel processing chips such as Pentium MMX, MMX,
Pentium, Pentium III and Pentium IV, it has been widely
used in image processing all over the world, and OpenCV
has become a popular image processing software
