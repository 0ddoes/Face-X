### What is image stitching?
At the beginning of the stitching process, as input, we have several images with overlapping areas. The output is a unification of these images. It is important to note that a full scene from the input image must be preserved in the process. To construct our image stiching, weâ€™ll utilize computer vision and image processing techniques such as: keypoint detection and local invariant descriptors; keypoint matching; RANSAC; and perspective warping.

### Dependencies used:
- openCV
- numpy

### Steps to run:
- Download the directory.
- You can use any Editor, Notebook Or IDE's to open the image-stiching.py file.
- Run the code

### Example:

### Our panorama stitching algorithm consists of four steps:

- Step #1: Detect keypoints (DoG, Harris, etc.) and extract local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.) from the two input images.
- Step #2: Match the descriptors between the two images.
- Step #3: Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate a homography matrix using our matched feature vectors.
- Step #4: Apply a warping transformation using the homography matrix obtained from Step #3.
