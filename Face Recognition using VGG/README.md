# Facial Recognition Using Deep Neural Network (VGG)

This repository includes jupyter notebooks and test pictures of our project.

We are trying to predict the name of celebs in a picture provided.

To do this, we considered a well-known pre-trained Convolutional Deep Neural Networks, called VGG-FACE.

## Facial Recognition Using Pre-Trained VGG-Face + OpenCV
#### Jupyter notebook of our project can be found here [Pre_Trained_Vgg_Face.ipynb](https://github.com/NEERAJAP2001/Face-X/blob/VGG-Face-Detection/Face%20Recognition%20using%20VGG/Training%20VGG%20Model.ipynb)

## Result:
