# Facial Recognition Using Deep Neural Network (VGG)

This repository includes jupyter notebooks and test pictures of our project.

We are trying to predict the name of celebs in a picture provided.

To do this, we considered a well-known pre-trained Convolutional Deep Neural Networks, called VGG-FACE.

Then we created our own datasets and fine tuned the model, trained the customized model again.

## Facial Recognition Using Pre-Trained VGG-Face + OpenCV
#### Jupyter notebook of our project can be found here [Pre_Trained_Vgg_Face.ipynb]()

In VGG-Face, the dataset has already be trained and weights can be downloaded from [here]().

Result:
