### 1.Introduction 
Image classification (recognition) is one of the foremost capabilities of deep neural networks. Inception-v3 is one of the most popular convolutional neural network models for recognizing objects in images. Deep learning-powered image recognition is used by doctors to identify cancerous tissue in medical images, self-driving cars to spot road hazards, and Facebook to help users with photo tagging.
    Inception V3 by Google is the 3rd version in a series of Deep Learning Convolutional Architectures. Inception V3 was trained using a dataset of 1,000 classes (See the list of classes here) from the original ImageNet dataset which was trained with over 1 million training images, the Tensorflow version has 1,001 classes which is due to an additional "background' class not used in the original ImageNet. Inception V3 was trained for the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge where it was a first runner up
A high-level diagram of the model is shown below:

Convolutional networks are at the core of most stateof-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter
count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over  the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error and 17.3% top-1 error.

### 2.General Design Principles
- 1.Higher dimensional representations are easier to process locally within a network. Increasing the activations per tile in a convolutional network allows for
more disentangled features. The resulting networks
will train faster
- 2.Avoid representational bottlenecks, especially early in the network. Feed-forward networks can be represented by an acyclic graph from the input layer(s) to
the classifier or regressor. This defines a clear direction for the information flow
- 3.Spatial aggregation can be done over lower dimensional embeddings without much or any loss in representational power. For example, before performing a more spread out (e.g. 3 √ó 3) convolution, one can reduce the dimension of the input representation before the spatial aggregation without expecting serious adverse effects
- 4.Balance the width and depth of the network. Optimal performance of the network can be reached by balancing the number of filters per stage and the depth of the network. Increasing both the width and the depth of the network can contribute to higher quality networks. However, the optimal improvement for a constant amount of computation can be reached if both are increased in parallel. The computational budget should therefore be distributed in a balanced way between the depth and width of the network.

### 3.Factorizing Convolutions with Large Filter Size
Much of the original gains of the GoogLeNet network [20] arise from a very generous use of dimension reduction. This can be viewed as a special case of factorizing
convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. Consider for example the case of a 1 √ó 1 convolutional layer followed by a 3 √ó 3 convolutional layer. In a vision network, it is expected that the outputs of near-by activations are highly correlated. Therefore, we can expect that their activations can be reduced before aggregation and that this should result in similarly expressive local representations

Mini-network replacing the 5 √ó 5 convolutions:

This means that with suitable factorization, we can end up with more disentangled parameters and therefore with faster training. Also, we can use the computational
and memory savings to increase the filter-bank sizes of our network while maintaining our ability to train each model replica on a single comput
