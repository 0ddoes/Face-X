# Face-Recognition-using-SVM

In this reopistory you can find basics of svm's how they work and also
bit about kernel trick can be used to perform classification on non-linearly 
separable datasets.

## Perks of SVM:
* Their dependence on relatively few support vectors means that they are very compact models, and take up very little memory.
* Because they are affected only by points near the margin, they work well with high-dimensional dataâ€”even data with more dimensions than samples, which is a challenging regime for other algorithms.
* Their integration with kernel methods makes them very versatile, able to adapt to many types of data.
