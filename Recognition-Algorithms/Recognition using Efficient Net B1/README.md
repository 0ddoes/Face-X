## EfficientNet B1

I have implemented EfficientNetB1 architecture on Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset. The dataset can be found here : https://www.kdef.se/
The model has been trained for 50 Epochs with a learning rate of 0.001. And the following Accuracy and Heatmap is obtained post training.
