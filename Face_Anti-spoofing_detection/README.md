# About
- Facial anti-spoofing is the task of preventing false facial verification by using a photo, video, mask or a different substitute for an authorized personâ€™s face.

# How it detects

- The living body detection technology is mainly to determine whether the face that appears in front of the machine is real or fake. The face presented by other media can be defined as a fake face, including printed paper photos, electronic product display screens, and silicone masks. , Stereoscopic 3D portraits, etc. The current mainstream living body solutions are divided into cooperative living body detection and non-cooperative living body detection (silent living body detection). Cooperative living body detection requires the user to complete the specified actions according to the prompts, and then perform the living body verification, while the silent living body directly performs the living body verification when the user is not sensitive.
