# Machine Vision Makes the Move to IoT
<img align="right" height="460px" src="https://github.com/Vi1234sh12/Face-X/blob/master/Recognition-using-IOT/Images/aws-header.png">

## Introduction 
One of the most hyped technologies in recent years has been the Internet of Things (IoT), a trend that has entered our consumer lives via home monitoring systems, wearable devices, connected cars, and remote health care. These advancements have been, in large part, attributed to two factors: the expansion of networking capabilities and the availability of lower-cost devices. In the vision market, by comparison, these same factors have been key challenges that have instead slowed the adoption of IoT.
The increasing number of imaging and data devices within an inspection system, combined with more advanced sensor capabilities, poses a growing bandwidth crunch in the vision market. Cost is also a significant barrier for the adoption of IoT, particularly when considering an evolutionary path toward incorporating machine learning in inspection systems.

### **Evolving toward IoT and AI**

IoT promises to bring new cost and process benefits to machine vision and to pave the path toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into inspection systems.

The proliferation of consumer IoT devices has been significantly aided by the availability of lightweight communication protocols (Bluetooth, MQTT, and Zigbee, to name just a few) to share low-bandwidth messaging or beacon data. These protocols provide ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù connectivity in applications when delays are acceptable or unnoticeable. For example, you likely wouldn‚Äôt notice if your air conditioner took a few seconds to start when you got home.

In comparison, imaging relies on low-latency, uncompressed data to make a real-time decision. Poor data quality or delivery can translate into costly production halts or secondary inspections ‚Äî or worse, a product recall that does irreparable brand harm.

Embedded smart devices integrate off-the-shelf sensors and processing platforms to enable compact, lower-power devices that can be more easily networked in IoT applications


Traditionally, inspection has relied on a camera or sensor transmitting data back to a central processor for analysis. For new IoT applications that integrate numerous image and data sources ‚Äî including hyperspectral and 3D sensors outputting data in various formats ‚Äî this approach poses a bandwidth challenge.

To help solve the impending bandwidth crunch, designers are investigating smart devices that process data and make decisions at the edge of the inspection network. These devices can take the form of a smart frame grabber that integrates directly into an existing inspection network or a compact sensor and embedded processing board that bypass a traditional camera.

Classic computer vision analysis excels at finding defects or matching patterns once it is tuned with a known data set. In comparison, AI is trainable, and as it gains access to a wider data set it‚Äôs able to locate, identify, and segment a wider number of objects or faults. New AI algorithms can be added to a smart frame grabber to perform more sophisticated analysis, with the camera and AI-processed video stream transmitted from the device to existing machine vision software.

Embedded smart devices enable more sophisticated processing at the sensor level. Key to this has been the introduction of lower-cost, compact embedded boards with processing power required for real-time image analysis. Embedded smart devices are ideal for repeated and automated robotic processes, such as edge detection in a pick-and-place system.

Like the smart frame grabber, embedded smart devices offer a straightforward path to integrating AI into vision applications. With local and cloud-based processing and the ability to share data between multiple smart devices, AI techniques can help train the computer model to identify objects, defects, and flaws while supporting a migration toward self-learning robotics systems.

## What is IOT?
**The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.** The Internet of things describes the network of physical objects‚Äî‚Äúthings‚Äù‚Äîthat are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
