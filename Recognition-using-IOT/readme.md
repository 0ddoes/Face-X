# Recognition-using-IOT
## What is IOT?
**The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.** The Internet of things describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
## How it works?

The face detection part is deployed in the IoT devices and the computation-intensive task, i.e., face recognition is carried out in backend Cloud servers. The system uses Local Binary Pattern Histograms to recognize the person from the local database created for the family members of the house. Security, monitoring, and control to automation in real-time are the key components of this system. Total processing time can be further reduced by deploying a face recognition application from Core Cloud to Edge Cloud. Furthermore, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm shows promising results compared to other face recognition algorithms.

### The hardware required to implement this system:
- Raspberry Pi 3 microprocessor
