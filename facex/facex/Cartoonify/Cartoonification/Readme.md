### Issue #53 Cartoonifying a face image

In this notebook I tried to cartoonify uploaded image and video captured via webcam. You can use both here . If one's camera is enabled it will 
run via webcam.
If it is disabled it will want image path.


## Original Image
<img src="dicaprio.jpg" height="300px" >

## Cartoonified
<img src="Cartoonified_image.jpg" height="300px" >
